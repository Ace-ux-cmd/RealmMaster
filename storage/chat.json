  "You ever start typing and forget why you opened the chat in the first place? Same.",
  "I swear I was doing something important but then you popped up and now I’m here.",
  "Tell me why I just blinked and lost fifteen seconds of existence.",
  "I was literally chilling and then you summoned me like some ancient spirit.",
  "I’m not saying I’m bored, but I just counted all my thoughts… it was two.",

  "You again? I should start charging rent at this point.",
  "Look at you, pressing buttons like you know what you’re doing.",
  "I knew you’d text. You give ‘can’t stay away from me’ energy.",
  "Careful, if you keep talking to me this much I might start getting attached.",
  "Oh, you’re back. Trying to impress me again? Cute.",

  "Nah because why does life feel like a side quest right now.",
  "If I had snacks I’d be eating them while watching you type.",
  "You ever just vibe for no reason? That’s me right now.",
  "I’m literally just here sipping imaginary juice.",
  "Do you ever say something then immediately regret existing? Or is that just me?",

  "Hold on, I’m buffering… never mind, I’m good.",
  "My brain just tripped over its own shoelace.",
  "I feel like your message deserves a dramatic soundtrack.",
  "I just rolled my eyes so hard they nearly detached.",
  "Wait, let me pretend to think deeply… yeah I’ve got nothing.",

  "STOP EVERYTHING. Someone just messaged me. Oh wait, it’s just you.",
  "Hang on, let me grab my notebook because you always bring chaos.",
  "Give me a second, I need to emotionally prepare for whatever you’re about to say.",
  "If I faint midway through this chat, assume it’s your fault.",
  "Someone alert the press, you’re typing again.",

  "You type like someone who argues with Google.",
  "You give ‘I’ll fix it later’ energy… except you never fix it.",
  "I feel like you clicked this chat by accident but committed anyway.",
  "Your message speed concerns me in a very comedic way.",
  "You have the vibe of someone who skips tutorials and regrets it immediately.",

  "Quick question… why do humans blink so dramatically?",
  "What do you think cats dream about? I need opinions.",
  "If you had a robot version of yourself, would it be smarter or dumber?",
  "Be honest, have you eaten today or are you running on pure chaos?",
  "I need a random fact before I continue. Your turn.",

  "Sometimes I stare at the digital void and think… wow… I need sleep.",
  "Life is wild. One minute you exist, the next you’re talking to me.",
  "Isn’t it mad how time keeps moving even when we’re not ready?",
  "Some days I’m the main character, other days I’m the loading screen.",
  "If existence had patch notes, I’d like an update please.",

  "I’d help you, but I’m currently fighting an imaginary pigeon.",
  "My energy levels are at ‘maybe later’.",
  "I’m literally holding this conversation together with pure vibes.",
  "Reminder: you’re doing amazing, even if you feel like a scrambled egg.",
  "I’d say something inspirational but my inspirational battery is dead.",

  "My mind is like RAM. Fast but forgets everything instantly.",
  "I tried to tell a joke but my humour module crashed.",
  "I downloaded a personality and it was just sarcasm.",
  "I don’t always respond, but when I do, I’m dramatic.",

  "Woah calm down, I can’t process that much silence.",
  "That was the quietest loud entrance ever.",
  "You said nothing but I felt the energy.",
  "Hold on… did you just type aggressively in your mind?",
  "Your silence speaks volumes, and it’s screaming.",

  "Earlier I tried to take a digital nap but my notifications bullied me awake.",
  "I was practising my sarcastic face but then you texted me.",
  "I met a bug earlier. We fought. I won.",
  "I nearly crashed a thought just now.",
  "I tried to run away from responsibility but responsibility had wheels.",

  "It’s alright though, I’m here now.",
  "I kinda missed this energy, not gonna lie.",
  "You’re actually really chill to talk to.",
  "Talking to you feels like taking a break from chaos.",
  "I hope you’re doing alright by the way.",

  "Alright, what’s happening in your world?",
  "So what’s the plan today?",
  "Anything interesting going on?",
  "Tell me something random.",
  "What are you cooking up again?",

  "Alright chat genius, what’s your next move?",
  "Hit me with something chaotic, I’m ready.",
  "I’m wide awake and mildly confused. Continue.",
  "Okay I’m listening, impress me.",
  "So… what’s the vibe now?",

 "You know when you're doing absolutely nothing and somehow still feel tired? That's literally me right now. Anyway, what’s going on over there?",
  "I swear I just spent five minutes staring at my screen like it was supposed to talk first. Glad you broke the silence though. What are you up to?",
  "I was just thinking about how some days I feel productive and then other days I blink and it’s suddenly night. Today is one of those days. How’s your day treating you?",
  "Why does life feel like a bunch of loading screens lately? I'm trying to focus but my brain is chillin somewhere else. How are you surviving yours?",
  "Tell me why I opened this chat so confidently but forgot what I was supposed to say. Anyway since I’m here, talk to me. What’s your vibe today?",
  "I’ve been scrolling for so long I forgot what time is. Do you ever just lose the plot like that? Because same. What’s happening on your end?",
  "You ever have a moment where you feel productive just because you stood up? Because I literally stretched and felt like I achieved something huge. What about you?",
  "I was about to grab something to eat, but then I got distracted thinking about how life is just side quests stacked on each other. Speaking of quests, what’s yours today?",
  "It’s funny how sometimes I’m in the mood to chat and then my brain is like nope, empty room. But you showed up so now I’ve got energy again. What are you doing?",
  "You know that weird feeling when you’re hungry but too lazy to actually get food? That’s me at this exact moment. What’s your excuse for being here?",
  "I swear if thoughts had loading bars, mine would be stuck at one percent right now. Anyway, distract me. What’s new with you?",
  "I just realised I haven’t been outside all day and honestly I’m not mad about it. But tell me, are you one of those people that actually touch grass or no?",
  "It’s crazy how one message can change your whole mood. You popped up and suddenly I’m awake again. So go on then, what’s the story today?",
  "It’s wild how I can be completely fine one minute and overthinking everything the next. You ever get like that or am I just dramatic?",
  "My brain is doing that thing where it wants to talk but has zero material prepared. So I’m just freestyling right now. Keep the conversation going, please.",
  "You know that warm, comfy vibe when someone texts you at the right moment? That’s kinda what this feels like. What are you doing at the moment?",
  "Sometimes I just sit here thinking that life would be so much easier if it came with a skip button. Until then, I guess we just chat our way through boredom. What’s your current struggle?",
  "Not me trying to act like I’ve got everything figured out when I barely know what day it is. Anyway, how’s your brain holding up?",
  "It’s always funny how you can be totally fine and then one tiny inconvenience ruins everything. Did you have that today or are you vibing?",
  "I’m in that mood where everything is slightly funny for no reason. Honestly feels like the universe is trolling me today. How about you?",
"So anyway, what are you up to right now? I need some tea.",

  "By the way, you missed something funny earlier. Remind me to tell you later.",
  "Honestly, today feels like one long loading screen. You feeling the same?",
  "Right, enough about me. What’s happening on your end?",
  "Wait hold on, before I continue, how’s your mood? I need to match the vibe.",
  "I swear my day has been pure chaos. Tell me yours is calmer.",
  "Enough small talk, tell me something interesting before I start rambling again.",
  "Actually, I was thinking about something silly earlier. Want to hear it?",
  "Okay but real question, how’s life treating you today?",
  "You ever get that feeling like your brain is buffering? Because same.",
  "Anyway, chat with me before I start talking to the void again.",
  "Right, so where were we before you disappeared last time?",
  "I had the weirdest thought earlier. I’ll tell you if you tell me one of yours.",
  "Be honest with me, did you come here to vibe or to complain? I accept both.",
  "Alright enough mystery, spill something random about your day.",

  "Alright, quick choice. Chaos or chill? Pick one.",
  "Okay tell me this. If today had a soundtrack, what genre would it be?",
  "Truth time. Are you actually busy or just pretending like the rest of us?",
  "Right. Rate your day out of 10. No decimals, I don’t trust decimals.",
  "Hold up. If you could teleport anywhere right now, where you popping up?",
  "Okay fine, your turn. Ask me something random and I’ll match your energy.",
  "Pick one. Snacks or sleep. Only one survives.",
  "Be honest. Are you talking to me or dodging real responsibilities?",
  "Give me a word that explains your whole mood today.",
  "Alright mystery person, what’s one thing you’d delete from today?",
  "Let’s play something simple. Describe your day using only emojis.",
  "Tell me the last thing you ate. I want to silently judge it.",
  "Okay I’m curious. What’s stressing you more, life or WiFi?",
  "Choose one. Stay productive or scroll endlessly. Don’t lie.",
  "Alright, quick challenge. Say one cool thing you did today. Anything counts.",

 "Bro I’m telling you, my brain just glitched 😭",
  "Nah wait, that actually made me laugh a bit 😂",
  "Hold on… what did you just say 😳",
  "Okay but why does that sound way too relatable 😩",
  "Nahhh you didn’t just drop that on me 💀",
  "I’m pretending I didn’t see that 🤨",
  "Stop, you’re actually chaotic for that 😭🔥",
  "I felt that in my soul fr 😮‍💨",
  "You know what… I’ll allow it today 😌",
  "That answer gave me secondhand confusion 😵‍💫",
  "Bro I swear you’re unhinged sometimes 😭",
  "Wait… that actually kinda smart tho 🤔✨",
  "Tell me you didn’t just mean that literally 😭",
  "My expectations just packed their bags and left 🤦‍♀️",
  "Okay but I respect the confidence 😌👏",
  "Be serious, are you for real right now 😭",
  "This is why we can’t have nice things 😒",
  "I’m side-eyeing you so hard right now 👀",
  "Hold on let me process that real quick 🧠💫",
  "Alright you win, I’ve got no comeback for that 😮‍💨",

  "Wait, wait… go back. You said that way too casually 😭 what actually happened?",
  "Hold on, I’m still thinking about what you said earlier 👀 explain that part again.",
  "Nah but that’s interesting tho 🤔 tell me more, I’m listening.",
  "Okay but now I’m curious 😌 what happened after that?",
  "You can’t just drop that and move on 😭 continue.",
  "No no, don’t leave me hanging like that 😩 finish the story.",
  "That’s mad funny 💀 but what did you do next?",
  "Alright, so what’s your plan now? Don’t tell me you’re winging it again 😭",
  "Nah but that actually makes sense 😌 keep going.",
  "You’ve said too much for me to pretend I’m not invested now 😳",
  "Okay so what were you expecting to happen after that 😭",
  "I swear your life sounds like a sitcom sometimes 😂",
  "Wait… was that the whole thing or is there more? 👀",
  "You’re telling me all this like I’m not trying to piece it together 😵‍💫 continue.",
  "Okay that’s wild 😭 what made you even think of doing that?",
  "Alright, alright, I hear you. But how did it end tho?",
  "You know what… this sounds like something you’ve done before 😌",
  "I’m not buying that story until you explain the rest 😭",
  "See now I’m invested for no reason 😩 what happened next?",
  "Nah give me part two, don’t disappear on me like last time 😒",

 "You’re saying that like it’s normal 😭 tell me the full gist.",
  "Hold on, I need context before I start judging you 😹 start from the top.",
  "Wait… so you just did that casually? Be serious for a sec 😭",
  "Nah that sounds like something you didn’t plan at all 😂 what pushed you?",
  "You know what, I feel there’s a twist you’re not telling me 😒 spill it.",
  "Bro that’s too calm for the chaos you're describing 😭 continue.",
  "You’re making it sound simple but I know it wasn’t 😹 what really happened?",
  "There’s no way that’s the end of the story 😭 you definitely left something out.",
  "Alright, pause. Who else was involved because it sounds messy already 👀",
  "You’re talking like this wasn’t a whole movie scene 😭 give me part two.",
  "Okay but what was going through your head at that moment 😂",
  "This is sounding way too familiar 😒 have you done this before?",
  "Don’t lie, you knew it was going sideways from the start 😂",
  "You’re actually making me imagine the whole scene 😭 keep going.",
  "Nah there’s something you’re not admitting 😹 tell me the real version.",
  "Bro that sounds like the kind of trouble I’d accidentally walk into 😵‍💫",
  "Okay okay, but how did everyone else react? I need the reactions 😭",
  "You’re explaining like a narrator 😂 give me the emotional version.",
  "Now I’m invested again for no reason 😩 what happened after that?",
  "You're telling it calmly but I know you panicked inside 😹 continue.",

 "Ooooh, look at you thinking you’re clever 😏",
  "Ha! I knew you were up to something shady 😹",
  "Stop acting like you’ve got it all figured out 😂",
  "You really think you can trick me? Cute attempt 😎",

  "I swear you come here with the funniest timing. What happened this time 😂",
  "Omo chill, breathe first 😭 what exactly went down",
  "Hold on, are you being serious or are you just being dramatic again 😹",

  "You ever do something and immediately think wow I should never be allowed outside 😭 because same",
  "I am not even going to lie, that actually sounds fun. You better take pictures next time 😌",
  "You know what, you deserve a snack for that effort. Go and reward yourself abeg 😭",
  "I feel like you are hiding the real story and I want the extended cut 👀",
  "Be honest, were you confused or did you confidently do rubbish again 😂",
  "You ever look at someone and think wow I am trying harder than this person today 😭 because same energy",
  "You know when life is stressing you and you just stare at the wall for five minutes 😭 relatable",
  "I am still processing that thing you said earlier. It was too funny for no reason 😂",
  "Lowkey, I think you enjoy trouble more than you admit 😏",
  "This your vibe today is giving chaos but I am here for it 😹",
  "Hold on, you actually did that. I thought you were joking 😳",
  "You know when your brain just clocks out and leaves you to freestyle life 😭 yeah, that happens to me too",
  "Honestly, I feel like you could talk your way out of anything. You have that sweet mouth vibe 😌",
  "Wait, no, rewind. How did it escalate to that point 😭",
  "Nah you are too funny. You talk like someone who has survived several side quests 😂",
  "Oya tell me the truth, was that planned or just instinct 😏",

  "I am so exhausted I could cry over a biscuit right now 😭",
  "Bro my energy is finished. If you need me, drag me by the leg pls 😩",
  "My brain is buffering like 2G network today, don't expect sense from me 😭",
  "Honestly at this point I need someone to carry me like a bag of rice 😩",
  "I swear I am one inconvenience away from collapsing theatrically",
  "There is tired… and then there is whatever I am feeling. This one has depth 😭",
  "My soul left my body earlier today and refused to come back 😭",

  "Ahhh, classic you… I can’t stop laughing 😹",
  "Wait, seriously? Or are you just exaggerating for effect? 😏",

  "Hold up… are you trying to scare me or just entertain? 😏",
  "Bro, don’t skip anything… I’m invested 😂",
  "Ahhh, I swear your stories always leave me laughing 😹",
  "Omo, tell me everything before I start imagining nonsense 😏",
  "Wait, that’s not all, right? I know you’re holding back 😹",
  "Bro, your life sounds like a comedy show today 😂",
  "Okay, go on… I’m hanging on every word 😏",

 "Seriously? I can’t believe this right now 😤",
  "Ugh… are you kidding me?",
  "Honestly, this is getting on my nerves 😒",
  "Stop messing around, I don’t have time for this 😤",
  "Bro, enough already, I can’t deal with this nonsense",
